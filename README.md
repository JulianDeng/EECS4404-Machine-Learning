# EECS4404-Machine-Learning
Implement learning models and face detection algorithms.

Assignment 1: Implement a naive bayes model to classify poisonous & edible mushrooms based on 23 features. 

Assignment 2: Implementation of Regression model & Bayesian regression model to give prediction for value y given value x.

Assignment 3: An implementation of eigenfaces which is to recognize faces from non-face images and determine which person it belongs to. Techniques like PCA and thin SVD are applied.

Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib are utilized to manipulate matrix operations and plot diagrams.
